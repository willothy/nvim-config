# nvim-config

My Neovim config. It's a bit bloated (understatement), but it contains a lot of useful utilities and custom configs.

Features:

- Tab scoped sessions and buffers
- Lsp-based auto cwd / project management
- Dir-based session restoration
- Lots of custom tabline/statusline/etc components
- Open files from nvim terminals (flatten.nvim)
- Window layouts with edgy.nvim
- And more...
