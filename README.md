# nvim-config

My personal Neovim config. I would not recommend using this - It's setup for me,
I cannot guarantee that it will work for you, and I will not fix issues that
do not occur on my computers. However, feel free to copy paste snippets
to add to your own config :)

## Bloated AND Blazingly Fastâ„¢

- Over 150 plugins
- ~15ms startup on both my desktop and laptop
- Lazy load EVERYTHING. Only a few plugins load before UiEnter.
- I've spent a stupid amount of time optimizing
