  - Under 25ms startup on desktop with NVME ssds
  - Lots of Telescope extensions
- Tab scoped sessions and buffers
  - Lsp-based auto cwd / project management
  - Dir-based session restoration
    - Unintrusive, won't autoload unless you open nvim with no args
- Lots of custom tabline/statusline/etc components
  - Custom mouse events and UI buttons (nvim-cokeline)
- Open files from nvim terminals (flatten.nvim)
- Custom code action menu (preview WIP, hollywood.nvim)
