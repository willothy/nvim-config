# nvim-config

My Neovim config. It's a bit bloated (understatement), but it contains a lot of useful utilities and custom configs.

Features:

- Sub-100ms startup (on my laptop)
- Tab scoped sessions and buffers
- Lsp-based auto cwd / project management
  - Lots of Telescope extensions1
- Dir-based session restoration
  - Unintrusive, won't autoload unless you open nvim with no args
- Lots of custom tabline/statusline/etc components
  - Custom mouse events and UI buttons (nvim-cokeline)
- Open files from nvim terminals (flatten.nvim)
- Custom code action menu (preview WIP, hollywood.nvim)
- Window layouts with edgy.nvim
- Auto-resize with focus.nvim
- Animations with mini.animate
- And more...
