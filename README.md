# nvim-config

My Neovim config after many hours of optimizating and tweaking. Contains lots of utilities and custom configs.

## Features

### Bloated AND Blazingly Fastâ„¢

- Over 110 plugins
- Under 20ms startup on my desktop
- 20-40ms startup time on my laptop

### Tab scoped sessions and buffers

- Lsp-based auto cwd / project management
- Dir-based session restoration
  - Unintrusive, won't autoload unless you open nvim with no args

### Convenient utilities

- Open files from nvim terminals and other Wezterm/Kitty windows (flatten.nvim)
- Window auto-resize and animation (focus.nvim and mini.animate)

### Lots of custom functionality

- Async task executor
- Hydra / which-key integration (hydra bodies show up as groups in which-key)
- Noice.nvim message routes

#### Tabline / statusline components

- Harpoon mark position (click to toggle mark)
- Git changes (gitsigns & statuscol.nvim)
