I would not recommend using this - It's setup for me,
I cannot guarantee that it will work for you, and I will not fix issues that
do not occur on my computers. However, feel free to copy paste snippets
to add to your own config :)

## Bloated AND Blazingly Fastâ„¢

- Over 150 plugins
- ~15ms startup on both my desktop and laptop
- Lazy load EVERYTHING. Only a few plugins load before UiEnter.
- I've spent a stupid amount of time optimizing

## Some things I'm working on in this repo

- Custom UI elements
  - Simple floating scrollbars for split windows
  - Custom foldexpr and foldtext
    - Shows both the last line of the fold
    - Preserves extmarks / inlay hints
    - TODO: Preserves semantic token highlights
  - Code action menu with preview, based on dropbar.nvim
  - Featureful bars and lines based on heirline, dropbar.nvim, and nvim-cokeline
  - `ui.select` based on [`dropbar.nvim`](https://github.com/Bekaboo/dropbar.nvim)
    - This has now been merged into `dropbar.nvim`, so ignore the impl in this repo and use that instead :)
- `rx.lua`: Reactive extensions for Neovim (very WIP, kinda abandoned)
  - [x] signals and effects
  - [x] automatic dependency tracking
  - [ ] automatic cleanup (wip)
  - [ ] scoping & signal ownership
- `player.lua`: Playerctl UI for Neovim
  - [x] playerctl wrapper
  - [ ] nui UI (wip)
